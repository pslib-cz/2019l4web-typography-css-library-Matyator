                    <h2>The Best Article in the World</h2>

                    <p>I have worked as a designer for 16 years now and started my journey studying art and design back
                        in
                        the year 2000 in the UK. Since then I have transitioned from a packaging design artworker to a
                        newspaper art director, web designer, graphic designer, design lead and now head of UX with a
                        team under me across multiple products globally. I have worked for large corporations, agencies,
                        startups and small one-man businesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>I realised early on that I needed validation on my design work to convince clients or
                        stakeholders on why things should be a certain way. When I had no solid answers, that’s when my
                        interests changed to studying UX design.
                    </p>
                    <p>UX provides a solid framework of empathising, ideating, testing and executing a design. It also
                        provides data on design patterns and allows you to understand research. Couple that with
                        behavioral psychology and you have what I think is the best of the design practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>You should think about where do you want your strengths to lie, on the spectrum of a researcher —
                        experience designer — UI designer where do you sit? This is a question I ask candidates who
                        interview for UX roles. My advice would be to start by knowing all those areas so you have a
                        broad range of skills across the spectrum, once you start to progress in your career you can
                        maybe then focus on one area to specialise in. I, for example, have become a UX manager and
                        strategist, this is my core strength in the UX skillsets, but I can easily run research and
                        execute detailed UI designs, they are just 2nd to my core skills set of UX strategy and design
                        thinking.

                    <p>
                        You may be very strong at visual design and pretty good at UI, but have no understanding of UX
                        strategy and how to break down a project into the correct steps. This means you need to learn
                        that
                        area you do not know.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Learn</h2>
                    <p>Do I need a UX degree? No is the answer. You need to have a solid portfolio that shows you
                        understand the process and thinking, then the ability to execute your designs. Normally if you
                        are transitioning you maybe have an art and design degree, that is perfectly fine (I have a
                        BAHons in Art & Design). Even if you don’t have any degree, more and more companies are not
                        needing a formal qualification if your portfolio does what it needs to.

                        Take some courses online, Udemy has a good one by David Travis
                        https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-guide-to-ux/, that is the one I did when first starting my
                        UX learning. Online courses are a great way to understand UX processes and practice. Other than
                        Udemy, Lynda.com and Interaction-design.org also have some good content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Read all the books and keep learning all the time. There are many to choose from, but I believe
                        the following will give you a solid base.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Start testing UX design now</h2>
                    <p>Even thou you focus purely on design, see if there is any part of a UX designers process that you
                        can implement. User flows, for example, maybe user interviews or remote user test on designs to
                        validate them. You could even create proto personas for certain projects. Start structuring your
                        projects as if they are a UX project.
                    </p>
                    <p>I did that when I was design lead, ending up creating personas for us. No one told me too, I just
                        did it. I also started creating prototypes at low fidelity to better explain designs. There are
                        lots of small techniques and processes you can try to adapt and fit into your current role to
                        help you learn.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Wireframing and prototyping</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wireframing</li>
                        <li>Prototyping</li>
                        <li>Testing and iteration</li>
                        <li>Development planning</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Another thing I adopted was user interviews with a regular cadence, getting these done for
                        feedback on designs, products or websites is a core part of a UX role.
                    </p>
                    <p>You should also look out for any startups or non-profit organisations you may be able to help for
                        free, this means you can conduct UX design work you have learned and try to apply it. It’s ok
                        that you won’t always get it perfect, you are working for free and I am sure it will still be a
                        massive help.

                    <h2>Competitions</h2>
                    <p>If you enter a competition then you may get a real-world brief you can breakdown and show UX
                        process and design for. I hired a UX junior based on him having a strong portfolio piece from a
                        competition that he won.
